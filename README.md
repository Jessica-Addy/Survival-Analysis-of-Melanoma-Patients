# Survival-Analysis-of-Melanoma-Patients
The Melanoma dataset in the MASS library from R was used in this survival analysis.
The data consist of measurements made on patients with malignant melanoma. Each patient had their tumour removed by surgery at the Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of Odense, Denmark during the period 1962 to 1977. 

The surgery consisted of complete removal of the tumour together with about 2.5cm of the surrounding skin. Among the measurements taken were the thickness of the tumour and whether it was ulcerated or not. These are thought to be important prognostic variables in that patients with a thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased chance of death from melanoma. Patients were followed until the end of 1977.

## Objectives 
  Estimate the overall survival using the KM estimator
  Compare the survival of males and females
  Fit a Cox-PH model by selecting suitable variables to explain the hazards of death.
